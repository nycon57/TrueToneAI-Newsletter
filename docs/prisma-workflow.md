# 🚀 Prisma Development to Production Workflow

A complete guide for transitioning from development to production with Prisma + Supabase.

## 📋 Quick Reference

| Phase | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Development** | `npx prisma db push` | Fast iteration, direct schema sync |
| **Transition** | `npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_migration` | Create baseline migration |
| **Production** | `npx prisma migrate dev --name your_change` | Tracked schema changes |
| **Deploy** | `npx prisma migrate deploy` | Deploy to production |

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Development Mode

**Current Status:** You're here now - use this for rapid development.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit your schema.prisma file
# 2. Push changes directly to database
npx prisma db push

# 3. Generate Prisma Client (if not auto-generated)
npx prisma generate

# 4. Test your changes
npx prisma studio
```

### ✅ When to Use Development Mode

- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Frequent schema changes
- Working alone on early features
- Testing different model structures

---

## 🔄 Phase 2: Transition to Production

### Step 1: Create Initial Migration

When your schema is stable and ready for production:

```bash
# Create baseline migration from current database state
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_migration
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Creates migration file in `prisma/migrations/`
- ✅ Marks current schema as starting point
- ✅ No database changes (schema already exists)

### Step 2: Verify Migration

```bash
# Check that migration was created
ls prisma/migrations/
# Expected output: 20241201120000_initial_migration/
```

### Step 3: Switch Workflow

**🚨 Important:** From this point forward, **stop using** `npx prisma db push`

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Production Workflow

### New Development Process

```bash
# 1. Edit your schema.prisma file
# 2. Create and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name describe_your_change

# 3. Prisma Client automatically regenerates
# 4. Test your changes
npx prisma studio
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy migrations to production environment
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Example Migration Names

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_posts
npx prisma migrate dev --name update_user_table
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_email_verification
```

## 📊 Workflow Comparison

| Aspect | Development Mode | Production Mode |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Command** | `npx prisma db push` | `npx prisma migrate dev --name xyz` |
| **Migration Files** | ❌ None created | ✅ Tracked in version control |
| **Schema Changes** | Direct sync | Tracked changes |
| **Deployment** | Not applicable | `npx prisma migrate deploy` |
| **Rollback** | Manual | Migration-based |

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### ✅ DO

- Create initial migration when schema is stable
- Use descriptive migration names
- Keep migration files in version control
- Test migrations in staging before production
- Run migrations in order

### ❌ DON'T

- Use `db push` after creating first migration
- Delete migration files
- Edit existing migration files
- Skip the initial migration creation
- Modify production database manually

---

## 🎯 When to Make the Transition

### ✅ Switch to Production Mode When

- Core schema is stable
- Ready to deploy to production
- Working with a team
- Need to track database changes
- Preparing for staging/production environments

### ❌ Stay in Development Mode When

- Still rapidly changing schema
- Prototyping and experimenting
- Working alone on early features
- Testing different model structures

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Migration conflicts:**
```bash
# Reset if needed (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

**Check migration status:**
```bash
# See pending migrations
npx prisma migrate status
```

**Regenerate client:**
```bash
# If client is out of sync
npx prisma generate
```

---

## 📝 Summary

1. **Development:** Use `npx prisma db push` for rapid iteration
2. **Transition:** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_migration` once
3. **Production:** Use `npx prisma migrate dev --name xyz` for all changes
4. **Deploy:** Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` for production deployments

This workflow provides fast development iteration while maintaining proper change tracking for production environments.
