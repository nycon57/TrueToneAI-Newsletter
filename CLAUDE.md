### Component Architecture

The project uses shadcn/ui components with:
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Custom styling with Tailwind CSS
- Component aliases configured in `components.json`
- Path aliases configured with `@/*` pointing to `src/*`
- Additional component libraries available:
  - **Origin UI**: Compatible React components following shadcn/ui conventions
  - **Kibo UI**: Custom registry of composable, accessible components (some Kibo UI components already present in `src/components/ui/kibo-ui/`)

### Key Libraries & Tools

- **UI Components**: Extensive Radix UI component set for accessible primitives
- **Animation**: Motion library for smooth animations and transitions
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas with React Hook Form integration via @hookform/resolvers
- **URL State**: nuqs for type-safe URL search params management
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for charts and graphs
- **Code Syntax**: Shiki for syntax highlighting with transformers
- **Carousel**: Embla Carousel React for image/content carousels
- **Utilities**: clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional styling, class-variance-authority for component variants

### Prisma Configuration

- Client generated to `src/generated/prisma/`
- Uses connection pooling with Prisma Accelerate
- Configured for both direct and pooled database connections
- UUID-based primary keys with database-generated values
